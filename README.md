# Simon-Game
## Made with HTML, CSS, JS and jQuery.
Simon is an electronic game of short-term memory skill invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison, working for toy design firm Marvin Glass and Associates, with software programming by Lenny Cope. The device creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence.
 
This project was made by me as an outcome of learning Js and jQuery.
